# Projects found in Deep Learning for Coders by fast.ai 

These are the projects I have done while taking "Deep Learning for Coders" course at fast.ai. You can find these in the the book and also in videos available at:

https://www.fast.ai/


You need to have these packages installed for it to work:  fastai, pytorch, voila, ipywidgets

On Linux, You can use "pip" to install them. I always use "pip" with "--user" option in order to limit it to the user installations because it has a tendency to mess-up the system packages if used as root. For system wide installations using root, I recommend using your package manager.


I will update the README file in next few days by answering these questions:

    What the project does
    Why the project is useful
    How users can get started with the project
    Where users can get help with your project
    Who maintains and contributes to the project
